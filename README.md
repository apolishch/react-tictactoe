known issues:

1) Really, the client side should be hooked up with browserify to allow using the rich ecosystem of npm packages

2) Remote playability would be nice

3) The MinMax algorithm doesn't quite work correctly for some cases. There is a bug somewhere, but I've unfortunately got a dayjob

4) Tests are completely missing. Tbf, this would probably help address 3

5) Styling

6) Break up the store into more modular reducers and pass around subsections of state
